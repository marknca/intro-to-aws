# 06. Deploying A Server

You'll need these files in section #6 of the course, "Deploying A Server". These lessons cover deploying a new [Amazon EC2 Instance](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and then configuring it to run [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org), [PHP](https://secure.php.net), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com), and eventually [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org).

These files automate the operating system configuration so you can concentrate on learning the AWS pieces.
