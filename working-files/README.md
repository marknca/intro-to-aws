# 06. Deploying A Server

You'll need these files in section #6 of the course, "Deploying A Server". These lessons cover deploying a new Amazon EC2 Instance and then configuring it to run Apache, PHP, MySQL, and eventually Wordpress.

These files automate the operating system configuration so you can concentrate on learning the AWS pieces.
